# spiking_neural_networks
Spiking Neural Networks, a bio inspired machine learning model.
There Is A folder Named DATA----|
                                |- Dogs
                                    |-image.jpg(10000 images)
                                |- Cats
                                    |-image.jpg(10000 images)
FOLDER M_DATA---> M_data has same data that has in the DATA folder, but the number of images was less. We used it to see the behavioral patterns of Spiking Neural Networks on a small dataset.

S_data----|
          |- cloudy
          |- desert
          |- green_area
          |- water
In each folder, there are 4k images. This dataset was used to check the behavioral pattern of SNN on Multi class dataset to perform Multi- class classification.
For DOGS VS CATS classifications, I have used the data from here

For the Multi class classifications I have used data from here
